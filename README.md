# My Weather App AWS

This project will be built through a series of videos. I hope to help people learn how to build an application locally and shift it to the cloud.

Before starting it will be ideal (not mandatory) to have a basic understanding of Python.

You can use this project as a jump start to build something more advanced or as a learn by doing exercise.

1. Create flask server with outbound api calls to obtain weather information
2. Add frontend static content to display weather
3. Deploy frontend to AWS S3
4. Deploy backend to AWS (Lambda)
5. Automate deployment (Terraform)

## Skills you will practice

- Python, Flask, Jinja templating
- AWS (S3, Lambda)
- Terraform
- Coding and research skills
- Bootstrap styling

## Requirements

- Python
- Code editor of your choice
- Virtual environment (optional)
- Terraform (optional)

### Helpful Commands

Create virtual environment:
`python -m venv env`
